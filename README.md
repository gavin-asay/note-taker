# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is a no-frills note-taking app in your browser.

The application relies on Node.js and express.js to store saved notes remotely in JSON format. Unique ids for each note are provided by the nanoid package.

This release includes a bug fix that made new notes unable to be edited after viewing a previously saved note.

## Usage

To write a new note, simply click on the title field to add a title, then the note text field to write any notes you need. Afterward, click the save icon in the upper right to save the note.

While viewing an existing note, click the new note button to start a new note.

Editing of saved notes is not supported at this time.
